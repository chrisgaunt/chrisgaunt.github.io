  An aspiring game developer spending time between the UK and Japan.<br>This blog tracks my journey into game design & development.

I've played computer games since I can remember. The Commodore was one of the first computers I played on. Treasure Island and Fire Ant being two games I remember well.

I went on to use consoles such as the Sega Master System, Sega Mega Drive (Genesis), N64 and Playstation and eventually continuing into PC gaming.

I've always toyed with the idea of creating my own games, but never took it further than building small mods or creating my own maps for existing games during my teenage years.
I did some flash animation and 3ds Max animation during my university degree, and although I enjoyed them I went on to become a web developer.
My career has primarily been in web development since then, handling everything from design to code to server management.

I was given the chance to review the Unity game engine as a tool for building a mobile game based around work we were doing on the web.
I built a basic example game by following a few tutorials and enjoyed every minute of it.
At that point I decided if I didn't take this further and try my hand at game development I would regret it.

On this blog I will be sharing my experiences and keeping track of my progress, so I can look back at my oldest work and see how far I've come.

I have a lot more to learn!
